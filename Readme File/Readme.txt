I have Created a CMS for the UDW where students and staffs can register themselves and login  to the website where they have access with proper validation. I Have given four access level for four types of users. 

**Everyone can reset their password by answering some information about what they have given while register into the system**

**All the user will see the UDW.php first

Students: 

> Register and login to the system with session and proper validation process.
> Can Enroll and book tutorial time and see the enrolled history and timetable for specific student.
> Update information and change password.
